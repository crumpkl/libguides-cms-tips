# LibGuides CMS Tips & Tricks

  These are some tips and tricks I use when building and updating the Gregg-Graniteville Library website (https://library.usca.edu/home). 
 
## Understanding LibGuides CMS

  ### Using Admin Groups
  
  ### Templates
  
  ### Adding Images
  
  ### Use the correct version of Boostrap and Font Awesome
  
   Because the back-end (creater) side of LibGuides CMS, it's important to make sure you're using the same version of both Bootstrap and Font Awesome (if using). If you use a different or the most current version on the front-end side, certain elements in the back-end will not load correctly. 
   
   For example, there are many versions of Font Awesome. The newest versions are 5.13, 5.14, and 5.15. However, LibGuides CMS uses the old version, 4.7 and in order for the icons in both the front-end and back-end to be present, we must use the old version. If you use one of the newer versions in your website, the icons in the back-end (header icons), will not load and might confuse your LibGuides creators.
